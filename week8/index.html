            <h3>Transforms and Transitions</h3>
            <h4>Transforms</h4>
            <p>This is our magic egg...</p>
            <p class=initial></p>
            <p>There are many ways to transform this egg. Let's look at a few.</p>
            <h4>Translation</h4>
            <p>It has been translated horizontally and vertically. (y axis is reversed, negative makes it go up)</p>
            <p>This could have also been done with translateX and translateY.</p>
            <p class="translated"></p>
            <strong>&#x26A0 Transforms don't work with inline elements &#x26A0</strong>
            <p>Just like with translate, scale can be done only on scaleX or scaleY. Here is an example on the x axis.</p>
            <p class="scaled"></p>
            <p>You can also rotate.</p>
            <p class="rotated"></p>
            <p>Or skew.</p>
            <p class="skewed">I love fries!</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Transitions</h4>
            <p>Transition have a duration (better in ms) and can target one or more properties.</p>
            <p>Transitions can also be delayed.</p>
            <p class="transitioned"></p>

            <h3>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
            <h4>Canvas</h4>
            <p>Of what I understand, a canvas is basically a container for you to draw pretty much anything using JavaScript.</p>
            <p>When would you use a canvas?</p>
            <p>Canvas drawings can even be saved.</p>
            <p>Canvas can do many things, including altering images and videos as well as including text.</p>
            <h4>SVG</h4>
            <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics</p>
            <p>SVG images keep the exact same quality no matter how much you zoom in or out on them.</p>
            <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
            <p>Here is a great video I found on making elements draggable.</p>
